## Magnolia on Jamstack

Deploying sites as a collection of static files on CDN is an increasingly popular way to deploy headless projects.
It makes sites very performant, scalable and secure.

Magnolia brings a great authoring experience to static site creation. Authors can have a live WYSIWYG visual authoring experience, with instant updates. While developers can still enjoy a fully headless workflow with static site generation.
